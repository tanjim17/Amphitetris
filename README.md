## Amphitetris

This is a Django website prototype for garment owners and vendors that automates procurement process and inventory management. We developed it for HackNSU Season 2, 
an inter-university hackathon organized by ACM Student Chapter, North South University. We became 2nd runner up in the contest ðŸ™‚.
